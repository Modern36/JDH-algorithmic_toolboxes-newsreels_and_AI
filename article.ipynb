    "effects needed, Dahlstedt continued. In particular, it was difficult to \"adjust\n",
    "the strength and character of the different sounds during live recording.\n",
    "Therefore, each sound is recorded separately as much as possible and mixed\n",
    "during replay\". It was no secret that such a practice increased the amount of\n",
    "film stock used. Still, it saved time because there was \"no need to experiment\n",
    "with different sound effects during filming. It is the studio time that is the\n",

    "effects during filming, has relevance for our audio analyses. On-location sound\n",
    "in newsreel production seems to have been both fashionable and valued during\n",
    "the period, but also technically demanding. Most sounds were added during\n",
    "post-production, especially voice-over narration, but our analyses alone cannot substantiate the relation between diegetic and non-diegetic sound. What is lacking within our signal archaeology\n",

    "newsreels did not consistently rely on synchronised or diegetic sound, it would\n",

    "written elements often mediated the relationship between sound and image, and\n",
    "their gradual incorporation into the audiovisual mix hence deserves closer\n",

    "There is no prior academic inquiry on Sefyr’s function in SF’s newsreels.\n",
    "However, the company’s twenty-fifth anniversary book described the aircraft’s\n",
    "role within newsreel production.\n",
    "Besides the fact that the airplane \"always\n",
    "lent something of the allure of speed and the wide open spaces,\" its merits as\n",
    "an express carrier of news were habitually emphasised. Momentum and tempo–chief\n",
    "characteristics of modernity–were often associated with Sefyr. One vivid\n",
    "example was the marriage of the Swedish Princess Ingrid to the Danish Prince\n",
    "Frederik in late May 1935. Stockholm cinemas were packed with audiences who\n",
    "wanted to see daily audiovisual reports surrounding the wedding, which took\n",
    "place in the capital. The SF newsreel department had even promised coverage of\n",
    "the princely couple’s arrival in Copenhagen aboard the Danish royal yacht:\n",
    "\"There was nothing to do but advertise it.  \n",
    "Without reservation. Sefyr was the guarantor.\" \n",
    "In fact, Sefyr’s \"popular pilot,\" Åke Söderberg, arrived in\n",
    "Copenhagen the day before to make preparations, together with a reporter and a\n",
    "cameraman. As soon as the team had shot their material from both air and land,\n",
    "the airplane took off for Stockholm with the reels. Sefyr landed in Stockholm\n",
    "at 18:40; the reels were then developed and edited, and a few hours later the\n",
    "sequences were shown to audiences by the end of that evening’s last screenings\n",
    "in Stockholm\n",
    "<cite id=\"3m0ns\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22783102%2FZWKH378T\">(Skoglund 1944)</a></cite>.\n",
    "Moreover, in December 1936, _Stockholms-Tidningen_ proudly proclaimed with a\n",
    "large header in _Aftonbladet_ the aircraft’s faithful service: \"the only\n",
    "newspaper in the Nordic countries with its own news aircraft ... Sefyr will\n",
    "guarantee the best film material also in 1937\"\n",
    "<cite id=\"eyvnd\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22783102%2FYQMWCYSZ\">(Aftonbladet 1936)</a></cite>\n",
    "In a similar vein, readers were reassured that \"wherever something happens,\n",
    "someone from our wide circle of colleagues is always there to relay the news\n",
    "back to us by telephone, car or airplane\"\n",
    "<cite id=\"qppci\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22783102%2FERJVIH9J\">(Aftonbladet 1936a)</a></cite>.\n",
    "Sefyr was, hence, not merely a tool for speeding up news\n",
    "distribution. It also formed part of a broader self-image of a technologically\n",
    "well-equipped, mobile and tempo-prone news organisation—a flying symbol of\n",
    "journalistic modernity."

    "The applications and language models that the datalab at the National Library of Sweden has launched in recent years, have primarily been trained on older, digitized collections of audiovisual material. The various KB-Whisper models, for example, have been developed using some 50,000 hours of Swedish speech data—some of which comes from the digitized Journal Digital film collection. The main reason why the National Library is working with these types of models is that they will (or might) contribute to AI development within the Swedish public sector. Recently, the National Library even received a government mandate, and extra funding, to develop further and more advanced models. It is of course admirable that older moving image heritage data can be used for novel AI development. Moreover, some of these models, and especially AST applications, are naturally also of benefit for heritage institutions, since they can enhance metadata of elderly film or television collections. "

    "Then again, in this article we have also shown how such models, and AI-powered transmediation of newsreels, can open up new research venues that were previously inaccessible. Even if there are perhaps no particular or specific findings in our article, we have nevertheless demonstrated how signal archaeology and text extraction of intertitles, named entity recognition and geocoding, offer new and fascinating ways to analyse a major film collection at scale. We have converted both film and audio to text, which in addition to making this content humanly readable (as opposed to watchable) also make the Journal Digital collection (re)searchable in an unprecedented way. Text gleaned from newsreel intertitles (or voice-over commentary) does indeed increase the scholarly capacity of such media historical sources. It should also again be stressed that flash intertitles within silent films have for decades been a nuisance for film historians. Through the tool stum this obstacle has at least to some extent been reduced. "

    "Moreover, we have used voice-over commentary transcribed into texts to create maps of mentioned locations in newsreels, and also shown how this enables a scalable geographical reading. By using a distant reading framework, we have moved from data-driven overviews of geographic frequency, to close readings of individual locations—and back again. This approach has allowed us to chart not only how certain places were made visible—and how often. But also in what narrative contexts they appeared, thereby reconstructing a Swedish cultural landscape formed in part by newsreel depiction, in a manner that would have been prohibitively difficult using qualitative or quantitative methods alone. Similarly, we have added a multimodal object-annotation to 2,319 films, and have shown that what is seen is often not what is heard. By examining the patterns of which object pairs are most often detected together across the Journal Digital collection, we have furthermore examined how a diegetic strategy of newsreels evolved in a non-linear fashion."

    "The Journal Digital film collection offers a rich, multimodal window into Swedish 20th century history, which requires different angles of approach to be fully explored. We have investigated some of these, processing both audio and film with multiple pipelines. These pipelines are very different in nature, but they have two important elements in common: Firstly, the heavy lifting of these pipelines rely on existing, pre-trained AI-models and tools that were developed for different (and usually contemporary) materials—not old, historical newsreels. Secondly, the outputs from these pipelines require a moderate to a lot of post-processing before they are fit for analyses. It is therefore almost obvious that the code and applications we have developed for this article, have meant that we have critically scrutinised our own algorithmic toolboxes for the study of the past. By enriching films with metadata covering speech, intertitle texts, visible and audible objects, and geographical locations—all time-aligned—we have, finally, been able to breathe life into a collection that has, at least metaphorically, gathered dust within the confines of a digital archive. Within our article we have divided metadata use into three distinct tracks, audio-visual, intertitle-textual, and speech-geographical. As such, we have only explored a fraction of the available combinations of metadata."

      "abstract": "Abstract This brief article assesses an ongoing infrastructural research project focusing on filmarkivet.se, a website devoted to historical Swedish non-fiction film. As a collaboration between film researchers and film heritage institutions, the project has to date failed to overcome conflicting archival interests. Film scholars in general need open online archives and contextual resources, while some heritage institutions seek to give access solely to a curated filmic past. While cooperation between the heritage sector and scholars is regularly envisioned as being mutually beneficial, it also faces difficulties that need to be addressed and overcome.",

      "abstract": "This paper explains our work in developing new acoustic models for automated speech recognition (ASR) at KBLab, the infrastructure for data-driven research at the National Library of Sweden (KB). We evaluate different approaches for a viable speech-to-text pipeline for audiovisual resources in Swedish, using the wav2vec 2.0 architecture in combination with speech corpuses created from KB's collections. These approaches include pretraining an acoustic model for Swedish from the ground up, and fine-tuning existing monolingual and multilingual models. The collections-based corpuses we use have been sampled from millions of hours of speech, with a conscious attempt to balance regional dialects to produce a more representative, and thus more democratic, model. The acoustic model this enabled, \"VoxRex\", outperforms existing models for Swedish ASR. We also evaluate combining this model with various pretrained language models, which further enhanced performance. We conclude by highlighting the potential of such technology for cultural heritage institutions with vast collections of previously unlabelled audiovisual data. Our models are released for further exploration and research here: https://huggingface.co/KBLab.",

      "abstract": "Previous approaches for scene text detection have already achieved promising performances across various benchmarks. However, they usually fall short when dealing with challenging scenarios, even when equipped with deep neural network models, because the overall performance is determined by the interplay of multiple stages and components in the pipelines. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline that yields fast and accurate text detection in natural scenes. The pipeline directly predicts words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and quadrilateral shapes in full images, eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps (e.g., candidate aggregation and word partitioning), with a single neural network. The simplicity of our pipeline allows concentrating efforts on designing loss functions and neural network architecture. Experiments on standard datasets including ICDAR 2015, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency. On the ICDAR 2015 dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves an F-score of 0.7820 at 13.2fps at 720p resolution.",

The purpose of this article is to trace and critically evaluate how AI artists use algorithmic upscaling to modify early cinema, more particularly surviving films of the film company Swedish Biograph, and how fragments of this company’s cinematic past circulate online today.",
